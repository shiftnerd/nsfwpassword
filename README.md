NSFW Password Generator

NSFW Password Generator is a single-page static web application that generates secure, memorable passphrases using a mad lib–style approach. It leverages both custom and prebuilt word lists (including a dynamically fetched list of NSFW/curse words) to create natural-sounding, concatenated passphrases that are both fun and robust.

Features
	•	Mad Lib–Style Generation:
Generate passphrases based on natural language templates for a coherent, yet random output.
	•	Customizable Word Lists:
	•	Use your own custom word list (paste or upload via CSV/TXT).
	•	Opt-in/out of prebuilt word lists for Animals, Actions, Adjectives, and NSFW/Curse Words.
	•	External Data Integration:
Automatically fetch an external JSON list of NSFW/curse words from this repository, ensuring updated content.
	•	Enhanced Security & Usability:
Passphrases are concatenated (no spaces) and include randomly injected special characters for added entropy.
	•	Modern UI:
Built with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, dark/light mode experience.
	•	Copy to Clipboard:
Easily copy the generated passphrase(s) to your clipboard with a single click.
